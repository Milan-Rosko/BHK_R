    .../FLT.ml                Raw OCaml extracted directly from Rocq. Contains
                              the sumbool-based decider and the
                              machine-to-solver transformation logic.

    .../FLT.mli               The OCaml Interface file (generated).

    .../FLT.context.txt       Record of the backhround proof context.

    .../c005.txt              Record of the local proof context.

    .../p.dependency          Raw graph of internal module dependencies.
 

2 - Overview
    --------

    The result constitutes not a proof of FLT, rather, a result understood as
    “reverse mathematical” necessity.

    This directory contains:

    (i)         Extracted computational artifacts (deterministic programs
                obtained from the formal development).

    (ii)        Audit trails intended for simple reproducibility checks.

    The `FLT.ml` file is a mechanical artifact extracted from the verified logic
    of the C014 proof stack. It contains a "Missing Arrow" logic: the 
    constructive procedure that would transform a hypothetical Fermat reductio
    into a “forbidden result within the  `Fermat_Check_Witness` decidability
    kernel.
