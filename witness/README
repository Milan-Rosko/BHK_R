    ./witness/README          This file.

    ./witness/FLT.ml          The Computational Witness.
                              Raw OCaml extracted directly from the Coq/Rocq logic.
                              Contains the sumbool-based decider and the machine-to-solver
                              transformation logic.

    ./witness/FLT.mli         The OCaml Interface file (generated).

    ./witness/FLT.context.txt The Axiomatic Context.
                              Verifies that the main theorem relies only on the 
                              Solvability Thesis and the Cubic Barrier (C012).

    ./witness/c005.txt        The Adversarial Barrier Assumptions.
                              The logical constraints preventing "universal solvers."

    ./witness/p.dependency    The Dependency Manifest.
                              Raw graph of internal module dependencies.
 

2 - The Witness
    -----------

    The `FLT.ml` file is a mechanical artifact. 

       (i) It is not "hand-written." It is mechanically extracted from the 
           verified logic of the C014 proof stack.

      (ii) It contains the "Missing Arrow" logic: the constructive procedure 
           that would transform a hypothetical Fermat Counterexample into a 
           Forbidden Diophantine Solver.

     (iii) It includes the `Fermat_Check_Witness` decidability kernel.


3 - Scope
    -----

    This directory contains:

       (i) Extracted computational artifacts (deterministic programs obtained
           from the formal development).

      (ii) Audit trails intended for simple reproducibility checks.

    This directory does not contain:

       (i) A standalone mathematical proof text (see ../theories/).

      (ii) A new trusted kernel or alternative proof assistant.


4 - The Statement
    -------------
    
    "Fermat's Last Theorem is true in the exact same sense that arithmetic is consistent."
    
    The proof establishes that a counterexample to FLT would not be a mere
    numerical anomaly, but a structural violation of the 'Conservation of Hardness',
    implying the collapse of the arithmetical hierarchy.


5 - Reproducible Verification
    -------------------------

       (i) Re-run the extraction.

             From the repository root, run:
             [ ./proofcase/builders/2\ extract.command ]

      (ii) Verify the Axioms.

             Check `FLT.context.txt` to confirm that `witness_solvable_from_machine`
             appears as a Definition, not an Axiom.

     (iii) Compare the Artifacts.

             If you have a reference extraction, use `diff` to confirm logical equivalence.
             
             [ diff -u ./witness/FLT.ml <PATH_TO_REFERENCE_FLT.ml> ]
