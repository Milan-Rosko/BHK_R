    A constructive framework for computational realizability that asks:
    “what structural property makes some problems resist closure?”


1 - Overview
    --------

    BHK_R is a formal verification project leaning on realizability 
    interpretation, or Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorow-Interpretation (BHK). We
    propose a shift in how foundations of problems structured: axioms must
    become satisfiable through cryptographic challenges.

    Core Thesis.

    “Hardness” is not an intrinsic property of problems; it is a structural
    effect in any finite observer's ability to losslessly encode “Domains with
    Totality” (cf. Kleene). We call the resulting displacement phenomenon
    “Reflexica”. Thus, we cannot solve some hard problem by proof, but we can
    subsume two or more by lambda-invariance.


2 - Key Intuition
    -------------

    A problem P is "Reflexica-bound" if and only if deciding P uniformly
    requires deciding its own decidability.

    This self-iterating structure is isomorphic to a non-normalizing λ-term.

    Definition.

        Reflexica(P) := Turing_Definable(P) ∧ ¬ Known_λ_Definable(P)

    Turing-definability admits a TM computing P given unbounded resources;
    the finite-state component may be postulated without explicit construction.
    λ-definability requires a normalizing term: the solution must be fully
    exhibited, not quantified over.

    Church-Turing equivalence holds extensionally (which functions are
    computable) but fails intensionally (what must be exhibited to compute
    them). Reflexica problems inhabit this gap: TM-expressible promises that
    λ-calculus cannot close.

    Reflexica status is defeasible. A constructive witness collapses the
    certificate and refutes the bound.

    Architecture.

    (i)         Effective Device Layer: λ-definable operations inside a
                minimal constructive core; fully computable, fully explicit.

    (ii)        Reflexica Certificates: Named markers where Turing-definability
                exceeds known λ-definability; auditable single points of
                refutation.

    This transforms foundational axioms into falsifiable cryptographic
    challenges: if a scheme is broken without solving the underlying problem,
    the framework is refuted.

    What Makes This Different?

    Traditional approaches treat computational hardness as intrinsic. We
    formalize it as a structural property of observation systems, then reduce
    logical undecidability to "entropy" phenomena.

    Falsifiability Criterion.

    We establish formal reductions between logical undecidability and entropy,
    allowing a strict empirical test:

    “If a cryptographic scheme derived from this framework is broken, but the
    underlying problem is not solved, then the framework is false.”

    This moves foundational debate from ontology to verifiable adversarial
    evidence.


3 - Project Structure
    -----------------

    ./theories/         Primary source (.v Rocq files) organized by semantic
                        units.

    ./builders/         Automation scripts
                                
    ./_CoqProject       Standard logic path configuration.

    ./appendix/         Technical artifacts, OCaml code, challenges.
                                

4 - File Naming Convention.

    Files use lexical phase ordering:

        [ <Phase>_<Role>__Unit.v ]

        e.g., “P1_R__Pairing.v”

    Roles are:
    
        S for Proof Semantics
        R for Realization
        T for Façades / Theorems
        A for Certificate Layers

5 - Core Contributions
    ------------------

    We propose that several major computational barriers are corollary
    manifestations of an entropy governed failure:

    (i)     A calculus cannot simulate a solver without aliasing temporal
            resources.

    (ii)    Rational tape cannot address irrational geometry without
            aliasing coordinates.

    (iii)   A system unable to decide set emptiness due to encoding
            ambiguities.

    (iv)    A calculus unable to externalize its own renormalization.

    (v)     ... and more.


    We implement the following without classical assumptions:

    (i)     BHK_R Semantics. A λ-definable local logic serving as the organizing
            principle, enforcing constructive validity throughout.

    (ii)    Carryless Pairing. A structural arithmetic coding scheme avoiding
            prime factorization and multiplicative number theory. Instead
            relies on Fibonacci growth and Zeckendorf supports.

    (iii)   Weak local forcing derived strictly from reflection principles,
            permitting "as-if" reasoning within the constructive core.

    (iv)    Impossibility results for certified separators, demonstrating that
            self-auditing systems (those that prove Reflexica) must be
            inconsistent.


6 - Design Principles
    -----------------

    (i)     Explicit constructions. All constructions are terminating and fully
            computable.

    (ii)    Proofs don't rely on untracked gaps or implicit
            assumptions.

    (iii)   Certificate isolation. Every non-constructive principle is
            explicitly tracked.

    A preliminary challenge demonstrating the framework's falsifiability:

        ./appendix/challenge/carryless_vault

    If one breaks the scheme, non trivially, without solving the underlying
    problem, the framework is refuted.
