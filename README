1 - Files
    -----

    A collection of self-contained formal developments:
    
    ./theories/                 The primary source directory. Contains all
                                `.v` (Rocq) files organized by semantic units

    ./builders/                 Automation tools. Contains `.command` scripts
                                (tested for macOS) that streamline the process

    ./builders/_CoqProject      Identifies the logical path

    ./appendix/                 Accompanying technical artifacts

    ./.../proofextraction/      Sub-folder containing the OCaml
                                realizations of the “Fermat Machine“

2 - Contributions
    -------------

    Our repository implements several (hopefully) novel constructive tools
    to enforce hardness and barrier results without classical assumptions:

        (i) Carryless Pairing: A structural arithmetic coding scheme that
            avoids prime factorization and multiplicative number theory,
            relying instead on Fibonacci growth and Zeckendorf supports,
            see https://milanrosko.com/carryless.html.

       (ii) BHK_R Semantics: A lambda-definable local logic that serves as
            the organizing principle for the entire repository.

      (iii) The Mirror Lemma: A mechanism for weak local forcing derived
            strictly from reflection principles, allowing "As-If" reasoning
            within the constructive core.

       (iv) The Adversarial and Audit Barrier: Impossibility results for
            certified separators and self-auditing systems, showing that
            certain decision procedures cannot coexist.

    A central methodological choice follows from a constraint: we avoid the
    classical prime-power coding route. Prime-based arithmetization is
    elegant, but it silently imports a heavy (and expressive) multiplicative 
    substrate: unique factorization, divisibility, superpolynomial growth,
    etc. in a minimal constructive kernel this is not “free”, it forces a
    large arithmetic tower just to represent finitary syntax.

    Instead, `BHK_R` shifts coding to an additive substrate based on
    Fibonacci
    growth and Zeckendorf-style supports. Concretely, the repository
    implements
    a carryless pairing discipline in which codes are assembled as additive
    sums of Fibonacci values indexed in disjoint “bands.” Separation is enforced


3 - Organization:
    ------------
    
    Constructions are explicit, terminating, and compute what they claim to
    compute. Proofs do not rely on hidden axioms or untracked gaps.

    Files are named so the filename alone indicates phase, role, and semantic
    unit. We use a phase prefix to keep filenames valid Rocq identifiers
    (module names cannot begin with a digit) while preserving lexical
    ordering by phase:

        [ P<Phase>_<Role>__Unit.v ]

    `P<Phase>` is a nonnegative phase index (`P0`, `P1`, `P2`, …).
    `<Role>` indicates the file’s function within the phase.
    `Unit` is a stable identifier for the component/topic.

    Roles:

    `S` = Proof semantics
    `R` = Realization
    `T` = Stable façades, Theorems
    `A` = Certificate layers
