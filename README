    Our contribution is a collection of self-contained formal developments:

    ./README                    This file
    
    ./theories/                 The primary source directory. Contains all
                                `.v` (Rocq) files organized by semantic units

    ./builders/                 Automation tools. Contains `.command` scripts
                                (tested for macOS) that streamline the process

    ./builders/_CoqProject      Identifies the logical path

    ./appendix/                 Accompanying technical artifacts

    ./.../proofextraction/      Sub-folder containing the OCaml
                                realizations of the “Fermat Machine“

2 - Contributions:
    -------------

    This contribution is self-contained while the can be compiled with the
    Rocq proof environment (https://rocq-prover.org).

    Our repository implements several novel constructive mechanisms to
    enforce hardness and barrier results without classical axioms:

        (i) Carryless Pairing: A structural arithmetic coding scheme that
            avoids prime factorization and multiplicative number theory,
            relying instead on Fibonacci growth and Zeckendorf supports,
            see https://milanrosko.com/carryless.html.

       (ii) BHK_R Semantics: A lambda-definable local logic that serves as
            the organizing principle for the entire repository.

      (iii) The Mirror Lemma: A mechanism for weak local forcing derived
            strictly from reflection principles, allowing "As-If" reasoning
            within the constructive core.

       (iv) The Adversarial and Audit Barrier: Impossibility results for
            certified separators and self-auditing systems, showing that
            certain decision procedures cannot coexist.

    A central methodological choice follows from a constraint: we avoid the
    classical prime-power Gödel coding route. Prime-based arithmetization
    is elegant in classical settings, but it silently imports a heavy
    multiplicative number-theoretic substrate (unique factorization, divisibility
    infrastructure, gcd/normalization lemmas, etc.). In a minimal constructive
    kernel this is not “free”; it forces a large arithmetic tower just to
    represent finitary syntax.

    Instead, `BHK_R` shifts coding to an additive substrate based on Fibonacci
    growth and Zeckendorf-style supports. Concretely, the repository implements
    a carryless pairing discipline in which codes are assembled as additive
    sums of Fibonacci values indexed in disjoint “bands.” Separation is enforced
    by parity (even vs odd indices) and a rank/band offset function, rather than
    by multiplicative properties of primes.


3 - Organization:
    ------------
    
    Constructions are explicit, terminating, and compute what they claim to compute.
    Proofs do not rely on hidden axioms or untracked gaps.

    Files are named so the filename alone indicates phase, role, and semantic unit.
    We use a phase prefix to keep filenames valid Rocq identifiers
    (module names cannot begin with a digit) while preserving lexical ordering by phase:


        [ P<Phase>_<Role>__Unit.v ]

    `P<Phase>` is a nonnegative phase index (`P0`, `P1`, `P2`, …).
    `<Role>` indicates the file’s function within the phase.
    `Unit` is a stable identifier for the component/topic.

    Roles:

    `S` = Proof semantics
    `R` = Realization
    `T` = Stable façades, Theorems
    `A` = Certificate layers
