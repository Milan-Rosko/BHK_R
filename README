             “Every hard problem is also a cryptographic resource.”             

    We reframe the stalemate of foundations inside a cryptographic semantic
    layer, and treat mathematical truth not as abstract existence, but as
    “verifiable access:” the certificate supersedes the axiom as the fundamental
    unit of authority.

    In this repository, every global principle is classified as either:

      (i)  Effective device layer: computed inside a minimal constructive core;

      (ii) Reflexica core (uniformity): imported explicitly as a named
           certificates whose consequences are fully tracked.

    This is the intended “axiom → certificate” shift: devices are computable and
    testable; certificates are auditable single points of failure.

 	The project is inspired by Martin-Löf type theory (MLTT) and
    realizability interpretations (BHK).

                                (tested on macOS) that streamline the process.

    ./builders/_CoqProject      Identifies the logical path.

                                exposition.


2 - Contribution
    ------------

    Thesis. “Hardness” is not an intrinsic property of problems; it is a
    structural defect in any finite observer’s ability to losslessly encode
    “Domains with Totality” (cf. Kleene). We call the resulting displacement
    phenomenon “Reflexica”.

                   “We do not solve hard problems by proof;
                   we solve them by invariance.”

    We do not claim to “solve hard problems.” Here, we formalize a method of
    problem reduction on grounds of “ontology-free λ-invariance.” Several major
    obstructions might be corollary manifestations of a single failure mode,
    once “truth” is interpreted as “verifiable access”.

    This repository formalizes the thesis that several major “Hard Problems”
    are corollary manifestations of the Reflexica failure:

        (i) The failure of a verifier to simulate a solver without aliasing
            temporal resources;

       (ii) The failure of a rational tape to address irrational geometry
            without aliasing coordinates;

      (iii) The failure of a system to decide set emptiness due to encoding
            ambiguities;

       (iv) The failure of a system to externalize its own renormalization;

        (v) ... etc.

    Our first canonical limit is synchronized to additive pairing:

    For a chosen effective pairing device, the “global inversion law” (uniform
    recovery for all inputs) is not derivable inside the pure constructive
    nucleus; it must be isolated as an explicit certificate, until proven
    otherwise.

    This is not the claim that pairing functions do not exist. It is a claim
    about where uniform correctness lives under this semantics: in the
    certificate layer.


3 - Falsifiability
    --------------

    We posit a falsifiability criterion. Since we establish a formal reduction
    between logical undecidability and “entropy”, we allow ourselves
    an epistemic wager, in that we assert that every “Reflexica certificate”
    (as a distilled obstruction) corresponds to, or admits, a secure
    cryptographic primitive.

    This gives us a strict falsifiability criterion:

    “If a cryptographic scheme derived from this framework is broken,
    but the underlying problem is not solved, then the framework is false.”

    In other words, we move foundational debate away from ontology into
    verifiable adversarial evidence.

    A first preliminary “challange” can be found in:

    ./builders/


4 - Staring Tools
    -------------


    To enforce these results without relying on classical assumptions, we
    implement the following constructive tools:

        (i) “BHK_R Semantics:” A lambda-definable local logic that serves as
            the organizing principle for the entire repository, enforcing
            constructive validity.

       (ii) “Carryless Pairing:” A structural arithmetic coding scheme that
            avoids prime factorization and multiplicative number theory,
            relying instead on Fibonacci growth and Zeckendorf supports.
            See: https://milanrosko.com/carryless.html

      (iii) “The Mirror Lemma:” A mechanism for weak local forcing derived
            strictly from reflection principles, permitting “as-if” reasoning
            within the constructive core.

       (iv) “The Adversarial Barrier:” Impossibility results for certified
            separators, demonstrating that self-auditing systems (those that
            prove Reflexica) effectively solve the Halting Problem.


5 - Organization
    ------------

    Constructions are explicit, terminating, and fully computable. Proofs
    do not rely on hidden axioms or untracked gaps.

    Files are named so the filename alone indicates phase, role, and semantic
    unit. We use a phase prefix to maintain lexical ordering:

        [ P<Phase>_<Role>__Unit.v ]

    `P<Phase>` is a nonnegative phase index (`P0`, `P1`, `P2`, …).
    `<Role>` indicates the file’s function within the phase.
    `Unit` is a stable identifier for the component/topic.

    Roles:
    `S` = Proof Semantics
    `R` = Realization
    `T` = Stable Façades / Theorems
    `A` = Certificate Layers
