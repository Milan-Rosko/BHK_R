    A constructive framework for computational realizability that asks:
    “what structural property makes some problems resist closure?”


1 - Overview
    --------

    BHK_R is a finitistic formal verification project leaning on realizability 
    interpretation (Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorow-Interpretation or BHK). We
    propose a shift in how problems are structured and admitted.

    Core Thesis.

    “Hardness” is not an intrinsic property of problems; it is a structural
    effect in any finite observer's ability to losslessly encode “Domains with
    Totality” (cf. Kleene). We call the resulting displacement phenomenon
    “Reflexica”.

2 - Key Intuition
    -------------

    A problem P is "Reflexica-bound" if and only if deciding P uniformly
    requires deciding its own decidability.

    This self-iterating structure is isomorphic to a non-normalizing λ-term.

    Definition.

        Reflexica(P) := Turing_Definable(P) ∧ ¬ Known_λ_Definable(P)

    Turing-definability admits a TM computing P given unbounded resources;
    the finite-state component may be postulated without explicit construction.
    λ-definability requires a normalizing term: the solution must be fully
    exhibited, not quantified over.

    Church-Turing equivalence holds extensionally (which functions are
    computable) but fails intensionally (what must be exhibited to compute
    them). Reflexica problems inhabit this gap: TM-expressible promises that
    λ-calculus cannot close.

    Reflexica status is defeasible. A novel λ-definable witness collapses the
    certificate and refutes the bound,

    Architecture.

    (i)         Effective Device Layer: λ-definable operations inside a
                minimal constructive core; fully computable, fully explicit.

    (ii)        Reflexica Certificates: Named markers where Turing-definability
                exceeds known λ-definability; auditable single points of
                refutation.

    This transforms foundational axioms into falsifiable cryptographic
    challenges: if a scheme is broken without solving the underlying problem,
    the framework is refuted.

    What Makes This Different?

    We equate esoteric impossibilities to an unidetified source of entropy,
    while providing a falsifiability criterion:

    “If a cryptographic scheme derived from this framework is broken, but the
    underlying problem is not solved, then the framework is inconsistent.”


3 - Project Structure
    -----------------

    ./theories/         Primary source (.v Rocq files) organized by semantic
                        units.

    ./builders/         Automation scripts
                                
    ./_CoqProject       Standard logic path configuration.

    ./appendix/         Technical artifacts, OCaml code, challenges.
                                

4 - File Naming Convention
    ----------------------

    Files use lexical phase ordering:

        [ <Phase>_<Role>__Unit.v ]

        e.g., “P1_R__Pairing.v”

    Roles are:
    
        S for Proof Semantics
        R for Realization
        T for Façades / Theorems
        A for Certificate Layers

5 - Core Contributions
    ------------------

    We propose that several major computational barriers are corollary
    manifestations of an entropy governed failure. Examples include,

    (i)     a calculus that cannot simulate a solver without aliasing temporal
            resources;

    (ii)    a rational tape that cannot address irrational geometry without
            aliasing coordinates;

    (iii)   A system unable to decide set emptiness due to impredicativity;

    (iv)    A calculus unable to externalize its own renormalization;

    (v)     ... and more.

    We implement the following tools, among others.

    (i)     BHK_R Semantics. A λ-definable local logic serving as the organizing
            principle, enforcing constructive validity throughout.

    (ii)    Carryless Pairing. A structural arithmetic coding scheme avoiding
            prime factorization and multiplicative number theory, cf.
            www.milanrosko.com/carryless.html

    (iii)   “Weak forcing” and “Symbolic Regulation“ derived strictly from local
            reflection principles.

    (iv)    Various limitative theorems.


6 - Design Principles
    -----------------

    (i)     Explicit constructions. All constructions are terminating and fully
            computable.

    (ii)    Proofs don't rely on untracked gaps or implicit
            assumptions.

    (iii)   Certificate isolation. Every non-constructive principle is
            explicitly tracked.

    A preliminary challenge demonstrating the framework's falsifiability:

        ./appendix/challenge/carryless_vault

    If one breaks the scheme, non trivially, without solving the underlying
    problem, the framework is refuted.
