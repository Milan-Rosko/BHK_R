    Our project re-frames the stalemate of foundations within a cryptographic
    semantic layer. 

    The central move is to treat mathematical truth not as abstract existence,
    but as “verifiable access”: the certificate supersedes the axiom as the
    fundamental unit of authority.

    In this repository, every “global principle” is either:

        (i) Device layer (effective): computed inside a minimal constructive
            core;

       (ii) Reflexica core (uniformity): imported explicitly as a named
            certificate whose consequences are fully tracked.

    This is the intended “axiom → certificate” shift, devices are computable
    and testable, certificates are the auditable single points of failure.

2 - Contribution
    ------------

    Thesis. Hardness is not an intrinsic property of problems; it is a structural
    defect in the finite observer’s ability to losslessly encode “Domains with
    Totality” (cf. Kleene) We call the resulting displacement phenomenon “Reflexica”.

    We do not claim to “solve hard problems,” we formalize an “ontology-free
    invariance”: several major obstructions become corollary manifestations of a
    single failure mode, once “truth” is interpreted as verifiable access.

    Examples:

        (i) The failure of a verifier to simulate a solver without aliasing
            temporal resources;

       (ii) The failure of a rational tape to address irrational geometry
            without aliasing coordinates;

      (iii) The failure of a system to decide set emptiness due to encoding
            ambiguities;

       (iv) The failure of a system to externalize it's own renormalization;

        (v) ... etc.

    Our first canonical limit is synchronized to additive pairing:

    For a chosen effective pairing device, the “global inversion law”
    (uniform recovery for all inputs) is not derivable “for free” inside the
    pure constructive nucleus; it must be isolated as an explicit certificate,
    until proven otherwise.

    This is not the claim that pairing functions do not exist. It is a claim
    about where uniform correctness lives under this semantics: in the
    certificate layer.


3 - Falsifiability
    --------------

    This framework posits its own falsifiability. We establish a formal
    reduction between “Logical Undecidability” and “Cryptographic Security”,
    asserting that every “Reflexica certificate” corresponds to a secure
    cryptographic primitive.

    This gives us a strict falsifiability criterion:

    ”If a cryptographic scheme derived from this framework is broken,
    but the underlying problem is not solved, then the framework is false.”

    In other words, we move foundational debate away from ontology and
    into verifiable adversarial evidence.

    To enforce these results without relying on classical assumptions, we
    implement the following constructive tools:

        (i) “BHK_R Semantics:” A lambda-definable local logic that serves as
            the organizing principle for the entire repository, enforcing
            constructive validity.

       (ii) “Carryless Pairing:” A structural arithmetic coding scheme that
            avoids prime factorization and multiplicative number theory,
            relying instead on Fibonacci growth and Zeckendorf supports.
            See: https://milanrosko.com/carryless.html

      (iii) “The Mirror Lemma:” A mechanism for weak local forcing derived
            strictly from reflection principles, permitting "As-If" reasoning
            within the constructive core.

       (iv) “The Adversarial Barrier:” Impossibility results for certified
            separators, demonstrating that self-auditing systems (those that
            prove Reflexica) effectively solve the Halting Problem.


4 - Organization
    ------------
    
    Constructions are explicit, terminating, and fully computable. Proofs
    do not rely on hidden axioms or untracked gaps.

    Files are named so the filename alone indicates phase, role, and semantic
    unit. We use a phase prefix to maintain lexical ordering:

        [ P<Phase>_<Role>__Unit.v ]

    `P<Phase>` is a nonnegative phase index (`P0`, `P1`, `P2`, …).
    `<Role>` indicates the file’s function within the phase.
    `Unit` is a stable identifier for the component/topic.

    Roles:
    `S` = Proof Semantics
    `R` = Realization
    `T` = Stable Façades / Theorems
    `A` = Certificate Layers
