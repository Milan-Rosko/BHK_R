# M004: Conservation_of_Hardness

## Overview

M004 represents the “Invariant Layer” of the Delian Barrier. While M003 established that universal solvers are logically “paradoxical”, M004 further solidifies that they are “arithmetically” impossible. This module now hosts the SAT/solvability/quintic/cubic components (C009–C012) alongside the invariance checks (C013–C014).

## Construction Sequence

### C009: SAT_Reduction

Hardness conservation: a certified SAT solver exists iff arithmetic integrity fails. This module binds combinatorial hardness to the carryless arithmetic substrate.

### C010: Solvability_Thesis

The domino effect: if all problems are solvable (with certificates), every proposition becomes provable.

### C011: Quintic_Hardness

The “physics engine”: SAT separation requires transcendental (μ-operator) power beyond radicals, mirroring Abel–Ruffini.

### C012: Cubic_Incompleteness

The cubic barrier: the structural setup linking Diophantine geometry and the radical class, used to drive the conservation argument.

### C013: Logical_Cryptography

The Trapdoor Mechanism: Formalizes the asymmetry of computation. Proves that Cryptography is not an application of number theory, but a direct consequence of the complexity gap.

### C014: Fermat_Machine

Our main invariance check. This module establishes that the impossibility of the *Fermat Machine* (Fermat's Equation reinterpreted as the number of such machines) is a logical necessity, independent of arithmetical ontology.

We demonstrate that the "Fermat Machine" concept follows purely from operational logic established in C000 to C012. By defining the solver strictly as a computational agent (a Radical transformation of tape states), we prove that its impossibility is structurally invariant. The proof does not rely on a specific philosophy of numbers. It relies on the structural collision between a “Witness (the Frey Curve)” and a “Law (Modularity)” or “Reflexica” and “Cubic Completeness”, invariant to “Consistent T” or “Prov(G)”.

Machine Invariance: The barrier is blind to a Turing Machine's Finite-State implementation. It acts on the machine's interface.
